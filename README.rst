    MATLAB functions to read and write 3D data PLY files
    by Pascal Getreuer 2004.

ba_interp:
    fast matlab interpolation (not currently included in this
    code, but very useful).

surfaces:
    Some surface triangulations are included in surfaces/tri/
    Each should have a README file associated with it.
