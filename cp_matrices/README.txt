CP_MATRICES

These are matrices useful for implementing the Closest Point Method.

These codes assume there is an underlying grid based on meshgrid.  But
its important to note that one doesn't actually need to create that
grid...

TODO: add documentation or clean up an example on how to use these.

TODO: should also make a ndgrid: started this a bit, not tested yet
