CP_MATRICES

These are matrices useful for implementing the Closest Point Method.

These codes assume there is an underlying grid based on meshgrid.  But
its important to note that one doesn't actually need to create that
grid...

TODO: add documentation or clean up an example on how to use these.

Also works with ndgrid (mainly to make Tom and Ingrid happy).  Needs some testing
because haven't been used much.


just some mindless junk for now...
